<center><h3>How to create a plot set and export to a matlab script</h3></center>

<p>
This is a walk through for reading in a group of files, creating a set of plots, and exporting those plots to a matlab script. It is rather important that you have matlab installed, as all this program does is create a script file -- Matlab is required to actually run the script to generate the plots.
</p>

<center><h3>The files</h3></center>
<p> In order for this program to work, you must have all of your data in a text file, or multiple text files. These files will be in the format<br>
<i>column headers</i><br>
<i>[column data....]</i><br>
<ol><li>
All the column headers must be on the same line. </li>
<li>Blank lines are allowed before and after the column headers.</li>
<li>Each column header must be seperated by three or more spaces, or a tab.</li>
<li>Each row of data must end with a semi-colen (';')</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is best that you keep all of the data files for one set in a single directory. One, it is easier for you to keep track of, and two, there is only one output directory: when you parse the files ('run' from them menu) all the output files which will be used by matlab are dumped into the same output direcotry.

<h3>Running the program</h3>
<p>It is assumed that you have already installed the software. If not, you may want to do that now. Might help with this section.</p>
<p>In order to run this program, you MUST have a JRE installed. Hopefully you have one which is recent enough for you to simply double click on the icon which was (optionally) placed on your desktop. If you don't then I recommend visiting <a href="www.java.sun.com">www.java.sun.com</a> and installing the most recent version. The other option would be to run 'cmd' or 'command' depending on your version of windows, cd-ing into the dir which contains the file 'matScriptGen.jar' and typing "java -jar matScriptGen.jar'</p>
